My goal was to recreate a mini Zelda breath of the wild with a Gameboy / Color emulator

I managed to create a character who can move around with the joystick or the keyboard

this project allowed me to develop in C for a platform other than windows, and to use the optimization and the memory limit of the console

to play, open the BGB.EXE emulator, right click and open the ROM located in src / main.gbc
